#Cloud Compass Inc. Digital Literacy Course - DevOps for Business Managers - Lab 1

##Introduction

In this exercise, you will be going through a set of steps similar to those that a developer would follow in implementing a new feature, or a bug fix, including deploying an updated build into a live environment.  The purpose of this exercise is for you to gain an understanding of the workflow, as well as the supporting tools that work together to provide the automation.
  
This exercise makes use of a basic "ToDo List" web application.  In the course of this exercise, you will learn how to access and navigate in Github, how code is stored and organized on GitHub, as well as learn how edits to source code can trigger builds and deployments in a DevOps environment such as OpenShift.

Each student will have the use of their own repo for this exercise, but please ensure that you access your *assigned repo only* to avoid causing confusion for another student.
 
##Access your your deployed ToDo List web application
 
The starting point of the exercise is that a version of the ToDo application has been deployed for each student with a unique url, which will have been provided to you.

To view your version of the ToDo application:

* Open your web browser to the URL provided.
* Enter some items in the ToDo list.

##Access your repository on GitHub

Each student will have been provided a GitHub username+password, along with the name of a repository that they will use for this exercise.

Each instance of the deployed ToDo application has a distinct repository in GitHub to allow students to work independently.

The steps to find your way to your assigned GitHub repository are as follows:

* Login to github [here](https://github.com/login)
* Enter the username and password provided
* Switch to the "C3IDigitalLiteracyLab" organization in GitHub [here](https://github.com/C3IDigitalLiteracyLab)
* You should see a list of repositories.  Select the repository in this list that was assigned to you.
* You should see a list of files. These are the contents of the repository.
* Congratulations! You are now a GitHub novice! 

##Edit a source code file

Each of the files listed in the repo are a part of the ToDo application, or some form of supporting material.  You will be making an change to the contents of one of these files.
 
To perform your edits:

* Locate the file "index.html" in the repository's file list and click it. The screen will update and display the contents of the file.
